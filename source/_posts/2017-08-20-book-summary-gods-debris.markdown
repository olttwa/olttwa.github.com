- Lots of assumptions.
- How do you deduce that God can be bored?
- The viewpoints mentioned here are very generalized and though they seem to stem from conventional knowledge and stereotypes, they aren't true when you experience them in real life. The most contradincting theory was that women value sacrifice. That may be good conventional wisdom. But that is definitely not a true wisdom. Today people are more educated than before, they consume more information than the generation before. Hence these people have very different and diverse opinions about everything and generalizing it is impossible.
- The world isn't actually building itself up, it is tearing itself down. We do not have sustainable practices. We have caused damage that is irreversible. We have reduced biodiversity and made many species extinct.
- Just because we have more information than we used to have before, doesn't mean we are progressing.
- One good thing this book offers is a new angle of looking at things. You actually think if this line of thought is useful or not.
