## Why startup?
- I have been middle-class for 21 years.
- Right from my childhood, I am taught just one thing. Survival. I needed to solve one problem. Now I believe I have solved that problem. I have a good skill set, plus a degree from a reputed college to back-up my claims.
- So it is time to quit comfort and start solving another problem.
- As a middle class person, I was quite frustrated that there were too many problems and nobody gives a fuck. The culture in India is so bad that nobody believes the government can bring any good change even after electing NaMo as a PM.
- So I started up to solve problems faced by 90% of the world's population using technology.
