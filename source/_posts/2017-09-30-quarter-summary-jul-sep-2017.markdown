I write about my quarterly goals, systems I set to achieve those goals and learnings as a result of that.
<!-- more -->

One day, my college senior Shobhit suddenly asked me: "What have you done in the past one year of your job?" I was blank. Because of multiple reasons, I revere him, I want to replicate him. So I asked him what system he has in place to help him achieve something. He told me he has quarterly goals.

### Goals

- Read Norman Lewis Vocabulary builder
- Read Andrew Hunt & Dave Thomas Pragmatic Programmer
- Read Kent Beck Test Driven Development
- Track where my time goes so I know how to make time for myself

### Systems
The systems I set in place to help me achieve above goals had me giving 30-60 minutes everyday reading books. 10 minutes went into tracking what I'd done for the day. I can safely say I've spent atleast 12-14 hours this quarter planning how to achieve these goals.

### Results
I fell short on every goal. I completed Norman Lewis 60%, Andy/Dave 52% and Kent Beck 37%. I was able to track myself for 35 days out of 90.

### Learnings

- Planning a lot never helps. Try to come up with a MVP. If that works, build something on top of it. If it doesn't, find another way to achieve it.
- Video watching had the greatest impact on time. On weekends, it gobbled up 8-10 hours, sometimes during weekdays it gobbled up 4+ hours which messed up my routine as I slept around 5 am and had to be in office by 10 am.
- Big bang targets are very intimidating. Start small and build up on top of that.
- I was off my system for a period of 5 weeks continuously because of travel. I should have planned some work during travel.

Being a little depressed, my friend Asheet and I went for a walk today evening in the streets of Kodihalli. Cool breeze was flowing. There was light drizzle, and the clouds above made sure no star is to be seen. In this poetic setting, I cried my heart out in front of Asheet. I wanted to become 2 things I had been in the past:

- Study 2-3 hours everyday without any distractions. (At the age of 16, I have done this well over a period of 7 months)
- Like everything I do. (In school, I listened very attentively to the teachers and friends' discussion. I always looked forward to waking up, going to school, playing football, studying, etc.)

Out of our discussion, 3 learnings:

- Set small targets. After achieving those, go for same or higher targets. Example: I have been trying to reach office at 9 since last one year because that helps me in many ways. I am successful only 1 time per month on average. Instead, I can improve by 10 minutes week-on-week.
- Forget the past system. The current scenario is different. Distractions, responsibilities have increased many fold. Need to build a system that is better suited for this time.
- Find the sweet spot with expectations. Expecting a lot from yourselves can be very demotivating when those expectations aren't met. On the other hand, not having any expectations at all is unpractical.
