While sharing credentials with our friends at work, we mostly use slack, mail or messaging platforms. For a more secure and speedy way, read ahead!

<!-- more -->

A few days back, I had to share a private key for our service account with a friend at my work. I used slack for that. Now my friend, slack and NSA ðŸ˜± all have our credentials!

A more secure and speedy alternative is to use `netcat`

To send credentials over a local network, put them in a file and use this:

For receiving data:
```
$ hostname -I (for linux)
'or'
$ ipconfig getifaddr en0 (for os X)
192.168.0.145
$ nc -l 9931 > secret
```

For sending data:
```
$ cat secret | nc 192.168.0.145 9931
```

After this, credentials will be saved to file on the receiver's machine. This will work for huge files with other content as well.
