## Always ask yourselves: what problem am i solving?
- I belonged to the middle class group. I solved one problem: stable flow of money for survival.
- Now I picked up tolltwa
- i did whatever it took to solve a problem. i paid bribes to get olttwa up and running
- i cycled 8 kms everyday and studied my ass off at night to solve the problem of money
- take example of those small girls that travel 40 kms everyday in a crowded bus everyday to solve the problem of education in their family
- never accept this: 'that's the way it's always been or is supposed to be!"
