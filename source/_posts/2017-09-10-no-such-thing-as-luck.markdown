- It is human tendency 
    - Human tendency is to find rationale behind every single thing.
    - - If they cannot, they attribute the reason to superficial things like God, luck or supernatural phenomenon.
    - - There are so many variables at play in this world that it is nearly impossible to take into account each one of them. Sometimes these variables combine to produce non-feasible events. We shouldn’t term that as luck or God’s work, etc.

Quoting gita:
This life is not the first time you and I have experienced each other. We have been here
before, but we have not learned, from past experiences, that much of life defies explanation
and control, that life always offers a second chance and that the world existed before us and
will continue to exist after us.
